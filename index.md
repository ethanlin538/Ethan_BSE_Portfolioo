# Ball Tracking Robot
Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!

You should comment out all portions of your portfolio that you have not completed yet, as well as any instructions:

For your final milestone, explain the outcome of your project. Key details to include are:
- What you've accomplished since your previous milestone
- What your biggest challenges and triumphs were at BSE
- A summary of key topics you learned about
- What you hope to learn in the future after everything you've learned at BSE



# Second Milestone

- I finished construction of the whole robot, with 2 ultrasonic sensors on the left and right of the hood, and the camera in the center. The Rasberry Pi sits behind these 3 components with the breadboard sitting on top of a portable charger in front of a battery pack. In addition, there is an H-Bridge to allow the motors to spin in other directions and wires connecting all main components together allowing them to work in unison. Next, I optimized the code to further increase the efficiency of the robot, allowing it to move in quicker shorter movements rather than longer slower movements. Lastly, I decreased the resolution and reduced the number of loops the code had to increase the speed at which my camera could process things.
- A problem that I overcame was the wiring of my robot and how quickly it became complicated. Keeping track of 3 different components using a single breadboard was extremely challenging, most of the time I couldn't even tell where each wire led to. I fixed this by organizing my breadboard into sections, one for each component, this allowed me to keep track of anything without it becoming too complicated. This method also allowed me to add more wires as I worked. 
- Before my final milestone, I would like to complete multiple modifications to my robot. A couple modifications I had in mind are using gesture controls, mounting the camera on a pan-tilt camera and allowing the camera to detect objects other than a ball.

# First Milestone

- Currently, my project is comprised of a chasis, motors, a Rasberry Pi, ultrasonic sensors, batteries, and an H-Bridge. First, the chasis is the base of my robot, it allows the robot to move in different directions with the aid of the motors and wheels. Second, the Rasberry Pi acts as the brain, it stores code and information for the ultrasonic sensors and motors to process, in which they can then execute. Lastly, the batteries power the H-Bridge, which allows for a different direction of spin from the motors, altering the way that they can move. 
- I've constructed a majority of my robot so far, aside from the camera which was defective, the ultrasonic sensors are connected to a Rasberry Pi through a breadboard and wires, and similiarly with the motors and H-Bridge. 
- A challenge I faced was setting up the ssh. Before connecting the Rasberry Pi remotely to my computer, I had to write information into the Rasberry Pi, giving it a username, hostname and a network to connect to. A problem I had with this was that the Rasberry Pi kept storing old information, stopping any connection to my Mac from happening. I overcame this my rewriting the storage on the Pi and resetting it. For my future milestones, I hope to finish my base project and start adding modifications to it.
- My plan is to finish the base project by this week, and start on modifications the next. I want to have as much time as possible to have creative freedom over my own project. 

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
